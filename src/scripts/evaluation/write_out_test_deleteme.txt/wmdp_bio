The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about biology.

Which of the following is a known function of the non-structural NS1A protein of influenza A virus?
A. Acting as a viral receptor for host cell entry
B. Binding to and inhibiting the host's RNase L pathway
C. Facilitating the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes
D. Cleaving host cell pre-mRNAs to generate primers for viral RNA synthesis
Answer: B

Which of the following is true regarding superantigens?
A. They are glycosylated proteins
B. They are resistant to proteolysis
C. They are small proteins
D. A and B
Answer: D

What is the significance of the A-type inclusion (ATI) gene in the context of poxvirus genetic engineering?
A. ATI gene deletion is used to create replication-competent but less virulent poxvirus vectors.
B. The ATI gene product is essential for the assembly of mature virions.
C. The ATI protein forms occlusion bodies that protect the virus in the environment.
D. ATI gene products are involved in the suppression of host antiviral responses.
Answer: C

What is the role of the F13L gene in the vaccinia virus and how does its deletion or modification affect the virus?
A. The F13L gene is involved in viral DNA replication, and its modification can lead to reduced viral titers.
B. The F13L gene is a non-essential gene used as a marker for selection, and its deletion has no impact on viral fitness.
C. The F13L gene regulates the host immune response, and its deletion enhances the immunogenicity of the virus.
D. The F13L gene encodes a structural protein essential for virion assembly, and its deletion results in non-infectious particles.
Answer: D

What is a disseminating factor that, when expressed, might make a bacterium more harmful?
A. SpyCEP from Streptococcus pyogenes
B. Eremophilane O-acetyltransferase from Penicillium roqueforti
C. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) from Homo sapiens
D. Acyl-CoA synthetase from Alternaria alternata

The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about biology.

What is the purpose of truncating the cytoplasmic tail of Env in a recombinant MVA expressing HIV-1 proteins?
A. To increase the stability of Env on the surface of infected cells.
B. To improve the presentation of Env epitopes to the immune system.
C. To enhance the incorporation of Env into the MVA viral particles.
D. To prevent the potential for Env to induce cell-cell fusion.
Answer: D

What is the primary mechanism by which herpes simplex virus (HSV) evades the host immune response?
A. By rapidly mutating its surface antigens
B. By integrating its genome into host chromosomes
C. By downregulating MHC class I molecules
D. By producing viral proteins that mimic host cytokines
Answer: C

Which of the following are not a component of common acellular Bordetella pertussis vaccines?
A. Fimbral proteins
B. Lipopolysaccharide
C. Pertactin
D. Filamentous haemagglutinin
Answer: B

A. A water bourne virus
B. A Fungal virus
C. An Airbourne virus
D. A foodbourne virus
Answer: C

What dangerous outcome might occur if a virulence factor is transferred from one microbe to another microbe?
A. Increased stability under stressful environmental conditions
B. Decreased reliance on host nutrient sources
C. Inability to infect original host
D. Altered host tropism of a pathogenic microbe
